# Python Fundamentals: Practical Task Suite

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating core programming concepts applied to real-world scenarios. Each task focuses on **data manipulation**, **conditional logic**, and **standardization**.

## 📋 Task Overview

| Task | Focus Area | Real-World Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Login Validator** | Authentication Logic | Security & Access Control |
| **Result Analyzer** | Accumulator Pattern | Academic Evaluation |
| **Data Cleaner** | String Preprocessing | Data Pipeline Preparation |
| **Message Auditor** | Text Validation | UI/UX Constraints |
| **Log Detector** | Pattern Matching | System Monitoring |

## 🛠️ Requirements & Setup

To run these tasks, ensure you have a Python environment installed with **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.

1. **Install Jupyter:**
```bash
pip install notebook

```


2. **Launch the Environment:**
```bash
jupyter notebook

```

## 🚀 Execution Logic

The tasks follow a standard computational flow: **Input  Process  Output**.

### 1. Authentication System

Uses boolean logic to compare user input against hardcoded constants.

* **Key Concept:** `if-else` branching and logical `and`.

### 2. Academic Evaluation

Iterates through a list of scores to categorize performance.

* **Key Concept:** `for` loops and counter variables.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Standardizes inconsistent string formats into a uniform structure.

* **Key Concept:** List comprehensions and string methods (`.strip()`, `.lower()`, `.title()`).

### 4. Text Filtering

Measures the metadata (length) of strings to trigger flags.

* **Key Concept:** `len()` function and ternary operators.

### 5. Log Analysis

Searches for specific keywords within system logs to determine system health.

* **Key Concept:** Membership testing and occurrence counting.

## 📊 Summary of Functions Used

* `input()`: Capturing user data.
* `len()`: Calculating object size.
* `.count()`: Tallying specific elements.
* `.strip()` / `.lower()` / `.title()` : Cleaning string data.
